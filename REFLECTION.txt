What decisions or assumptions did you make about how to design your program?
1.Use MazeLocation pointer vector to present map.
2.Use IntrepidStudent and TA pointer to present student and TA since there is only one student and 2 TAs.
3.Count use skill or climb ladder as one turn even fail

What was your test plan for your program?
1. Test every function right after implementint it.
2. Test move, appeased, pick skill, go to next level, instructor, ta after finished program.

What bugs did you uncover through testing? How did you fix those bugs?
1.Can not read map due to the new line character. I use gdb and found that it fail to delete the map,so I try to use if else loop instead of only if loop and print it to see is inside the vector, then I found out there are new line characters. I fixed them by ignore the characters which not in the txt file.
 2.Memory leak. I post the question to Piassa and use valgrind to fine where did memory happened. The memory leak was caused by not delete the pointer vector. 

What problems or obstacles did you run into while you were developng your program? How did you resolve these?
1. When I reset the level or go to next level, I can't set student's location because I don't know where the begin is. I solved it by add new member to mazelevel class to store the start location.
2. I can't make my program run again when fail to escape. I solved it by develping a chech function, it return 1 when escape, return 2 when fail, return 0 when not adjence to instructor.

What resources were useful to your in solving problems? Were threr helpful websites or Stack Overflow posts? What help did you get from the TAs and/or the Instructor? Were specific parts of the course notes helpful?
1.The Piassa is useful to me in solving problems, someone in Piassa help me find the memory leak, I also check some stack Overflow postsabout pointer vector memory leak.
